# AI advanced topic presentation outline

## Presentation 1

* Introduction (10 min.)
	* General overview of artificial intelligence
	* Relevant background information: 
		* games/Game theory
		* zero-sum games 
		* utility 
		* adversarial search
		* evaluation function
	* Examples of adversarial search in games
		* Deep Blue (Chess game)
		* Go
		* Tic tac toe
* Topic 1 - Deeper dive into minimax, an adversarial search algorithm (25 min.)
	* Overview of the core components of the algorithm 
		* Assuming perfect information for both players
		* Performance costs (Space complexity, Time complexity)
		* Using pruning to reduce possible choices 
		* An example of a minimax tree and its result
	* Alpha/Beta iteration of minimax search 
		* Improvements over regular minimax search
			* Performance costs (Space complexity, Time complexity)
			* Doesn’t need to search through whole game space 
			* More efficient pruning 
		* An example of alpha-beta pruning’s improvement upon minimax
	* Depth limited minimax
